# simulation_project

This project helps 437 students to easily create custom scenarios for straight road driving with lead vehicle or lead vehicle and side vehicle. Students can use the Python file to create speed profile for both lead and side vehicles, the speed profile has an average and variation amplitude and approximates random speed variation by adding up multiple sin waves with different amplitude, frequency and phase shift. 

## usage

1. edit the simulation.py file by changing Parameters as specified in the file

2. run simulation.py by typing python simulation.py in the terminal

3. run openDS.jar as usual and use the HighTraffic.1 scenario, since this project is built upon existing HighTraffic.1 senario 

## installation

1. install Python on computer

2. install packages: sudo pip install bs4, matplotlib
